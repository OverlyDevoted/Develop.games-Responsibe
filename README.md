# Develope.games. Responsiveness Update

One innocent day, when I was watching Pirate Software livestream, the stream-master Thor, talked about a compendium for aspiring game devs. So I decided to check the website on my phone for myself as I'm somewhat of an avid game dev... And oh my god, the things I saw... UNRESPONSIVE DESIGN! As an apprentice in front-end magic I decided to dibble and dabble and try to make the website more mobile usable for mobile goblins. I tried to not compromise on the simplicity of the website and the minimal use of javascript and more modern CSS features. With this I hope I can show stream-master Thor that there's another way, a more responsive way...  

## Features to make

- [ ] Navbar is now expandable on certain screen sizes.
- [ ] Hyperlinks now open a new tab instead of opening a new page on the same tab. 
- [ ] Redundant nav divs (they are not redundant rn as they scroll to the topic, without scrolling horizontally and they offset the scroll so the top of the screen is not exactly on edge of a textbox section)

## Current issues

- [ ] When button is clicked it does not go back to white on mobile
- [ ] When clicking on nav-section link, nav-section should disappear
- [ ] Twitch embed scalability issues
- [ ] Other websites
